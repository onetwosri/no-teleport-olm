# Guide to no teleport olm
#### by Sri and Fecal

This guide explains how to avoid teleports at olm without counting attacks or using any external plugins/timers. It covers running the mage hand as well as how to get into 4:1 or world scythe for the melee hand. It also covers efficient phase starts that facilitate this.

If you are not interested in any of the theory or explanations and just want the quick and dirty version, click [here](https://github.com/onetwosri/no-teleport-olm/blob/main/lightning%20cycle%20olm.md#summary).

If you have any questions about anything in the guide or any olm mechanics not covered in the guide, feel free to dm onetwosri#2335 on discord and I will be happy to help to the best of my ability.

**Special thanks to:** Tiprikidi (for original mage hand cycle idea and method, and for reviewing 4:1 setup method) and Sooperpig (for helping with clips and visuals)

## I. Mage Hand

For all phases other than the final phase, olm's attack cycle is as follows:

1. auto
2. null
3. auto
4. crystals
5. auto
6. null
7. auto
8. lightning
9. auto
10. null
11. auto
12. teleports

Meanwhile, running the mage hand can be considered a 3 attack cycle where you attack once from each of 3 locations:
1. melee hand safespot
2. mage side of head
3. the area in between the two safespots (will be called thumb for convenience)

Since olm's attack cycle is 12 attacks long and your mage hand cycle is 3 attacks long, you will go through exactly 4 iterations of your mage hand cycle. Here's a side by side comparison of olm's attack cycle vs. yours. Each colored number on the right represents one full mage hand cycle.

After teleports, both cycles repeat starting from the beginning. Since the cycle always stays the same, you are always at the same spot each time a particular special happens: you're in the melee safespot for crystals, the mage side safespot for lightning, and on the thumb for teleports. That means that every 4th attack that occurs when you are at the thumb is teleports.

Remember that the only time you tank a hit during mage hand is at when you are at the thumb and you splashed from the melee safespot two attacks prior (the exact mechanics of when olm faces middle on a splash vs turns towards mage hand are a bit more complicated but it's not really important so I haven't included it). This means that if you splash from the melee safespot, there is a 25% chance that you will get teleports on the thumb.

Obviously, this is not ideal. It would be much better if the special that occurred at the thumb was lightning or crystals instead of teleports. To make that happen, you have to shift your mage hand attack cycle relative to olm's, as shown below.

This image shows the three possible ways in which your mage hand cycle can line up with olm's attack cycle. Each one is named based on the special that occurs when you are at the thumb. As you can see, being on either crystal or lightning cycle allows you to avoid getting teleports during mage hand.

Of the two "good" cycles, you want to always be on **LIGHTNING** cycle. This may seem counterintuitive, since crystals are much less annoying than lightning, but this is the **_single most important factor_** for avoiding teles during the melee hand.

### Getting on lightning cycle

When you first start a phase, you are on teleport cycle by default. To get onto lightning cycle, you have to shift olm's attack cycle relative to your own so that he does lightning instead of teles on the thumb. The best time to do this is at the beginning of the phase when you spec the hand, since you want to get off teleport cycle ASAP.

The absolute simplest way to do this is to make sure that you are maging from the melee safespot when olm does his sixth attack. A tick by tick breakdown of standard phase starts is shown below: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/3oylhmK.png)

Note that for p1, your first mage attack will be on the same tick as olm's first attack, and that for p2, you will do one mage attack 3 ticks before olm's first attack (not shown in diagram).

Where you stand before olm's 6th attack does not matter, although you obviously want to avoid as many of olm's attacks as possible.


### Phase start examples

I have included examples of phase starts for many common specing scenarios. 

**You do not need to memorize all of these.**

There are tons of ways to get onto lightning cycle, these clips just represent one way to do it. Feel free to figure out your own methods and do whatever is most comfortable for you. When in doubt, you can always use the 6th attack trick mentioned earlier; at most it will result in you tanking 1 more attack than necessary. Several of the examples below also follow the 6th attack rule.


#### 1 DWH Spec starts

**1. Mage -> DWH (hit) -> Mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-C61WNwyVs

   Note: If you splash the mage hit after hammer, do not run all the way to the melee safespot to avoid tanking a hit, doing so puts you on crystal cycle and you'll have to tank a hit at some point later to get back onto lightning.

**2. Mage -> DWH (miss or <30) -> Mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sw3oF2UuU8

   Note: The 4:0 cycle after missing hammer is necessary to shift the cycle from teleports to lightning cycle. In this example I could have avoided tanking a hit by 4:0ing when I splashed instead of waiting and doing it later. The advantage of this method is that you don't tank any hits to shift the cycle, but it costs 1 tick (which you'd lose anyways if you don't have a scythe).
   
   **2b.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N25g0sNXDY
   
   Alternative method to shift cycle to lightning without losing a tick. Note that running to the mage hand like I did is unnecessary since olm is facing there anyways. You can just afk at the mage hand safespot and tank auto+null then continue running the mage hand. 

**3. Mage (splash) -> DWH -> Mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMd62GX1Wjw

   Note: After my hammer, I was on teleport cycle. To shift to lightning, I ran to the mage hand when I splashed (which conveneniently happened right away). If you don't want to wait for a splash, you can do 1 mage hand cycle and then tank 2 hits at the mage side safespot as shown in example **2b**.
   
   If your DWH doesn't cripple the hand, you can alternatively choose to do a 4:0 cycle instead of running to the mage hand, like in example **2a**.

**4. Mage (hit) -> DWH (hit) -> Scythe -> Mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GchYxaHHAqA

**5. Mage (hit) -> DWH (miss) -> Scythe -> Mage**

Clip pending. See #7 in the meantime, it's exactly the same except that you mage same tick as olm instead of 1t behind since scythe is 5t unlike hammer, which is 6t.


#### 2 DWH Spec starts

**6. Mage -> DWH (miss) -> DWH (miss or hit under 30) -> lance -> mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyUPRsW0Ohs

**7. Mage -> DWH (miss) -> DWH (hit 30+ aka cripple) -> mage**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ta25GwTezA

   Use this one if you don't have a lance with you even if you don't cripple the hand. Technically you can save energy by just standing still and doing 2 mage attacks after hammering, just like in example #4. I prefer clicking to run to the mage hand as I do my second spec so that I don't need to instantly react to my exp drop in order to do #6.
   
#### Basic knowledge for shifting mage hand cycle

There are a few different ways to shift the cycle:
    1. Tanking a hit instead of moving to the next safespot.
        - This shifts the cycle by 1 (**crystals -> lightning**, or lightning -> teleports, or teleports -> crystals)
    2. Making the head turn from mage side to melee immediately.
        - Examples of this are what happens when you land your dwh or you do a single cycle of 4:0 like in 1 DWH start example #3.
        - This shifts the cycle *forward* by 1 (crystals -> teleports, or lightning -> crystals, or **teleports -> lightning**)
    3. Running all the way to the mage hand *without* skipping hits
        - Example is what you do when you cripple the hand with mage->dwh->dwh
        - This shifts the cycle back by 2 (crystals -> teleports, or lightning -> crystals, or **teleports -> lightning**)

## II. Melee Hand

The advantage of knowing which mage hand cycle you are on is that it makes the timing of teleports somewhat predictable; you know which attacks have a chance of being teleports. For lightning cycle, this happens when you are at the melee safespot. Knowing this allows you to setup the melee hand in such a way that you avoid tanking all attacks that have a chance of being teleports.

This is complicated by the cycle shift that sometimes occurs when the mage hand dies, but all the methods shown below take this into account, so you don't need to worry about it.

We (and Tiprikidi, who figured it before us) have chosen not to release the exact mechanics of the cycle shift as doing so could allow for cheat clients/plugins that accurately count and track olm's attack cycle, which would reduce the fun and challenge of solo olm.

### Setting up 4:1

Setting up 4:1 while on lightning cycle is extremely simple; all you have to do is follow one of the following 4 scenarios based on when you cast the attack that kills the mage hand. It might seem confusing at first, but for the most part, the methods are extremely intuitive and once you do them a few times they will become automatic.

All clips include at least part of the mage hand so that you can verify that I'm on lightning cycle. You can skip forward until the mage hand is almost dead in order to see the 4:1 transition.

P.s. many of the clips have scuffed audio and grandma clicks (sorry), but they should still be decent examples

##### Scenario 1: Killing mage hand from the mage side safespot

After killing the mage hand, immediately switch to melee and hit melee hand. The head should turn middle (unless it was already facing middle due to a splash, in which case it will use an attack, which you should ignore). Then, just keep hitting the hand while tanking 2 hits to check where you are in the cycle.

**Examples:**

https://streamable.com/304nga

**Note:** There is one scenario in which your 2 check hits will not be accurate. This is shown below. If this happens, don't worry as it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Just get into 4:1 after lightning.

##### Scenario 2: Killing the mage hand from the thumb area (maging same tick as olm)

If you are maging same tick as olm, then after dealing the killing blow to the hand, run to the melee safespot and hit the hand. Then, tank 1 hit on the thumb before turning the head again, then tank 2 attacks to check the cycle.

**Examples:**

https://streamable.com/hqiedo

https://streamable.com/o8hgvi

##### Scenario 3: Killing the mage hand from the thumb area (maging 1t behind olm)

If you are maging 1t behind olm, then after you kill the hand, run to the melee safespot and hit the hand. Then, tank two hits to check the cycle while making your way to the thumb.

**Examples:**

https://streamable.com/wug42d

https://streamable.com/bxrl5e

##### Scenario 4: Killing the mage hand from the melee safespot

If you kill the mage hand from the melee safespot, turn the head **exactly THREE** times, before tanking two hits to check the cycle. The first head turn is when olm turns from melee safespot to mage side. This means that you only go to the melee safespot if your first lance hit noodles, causing olm to turn middle instead of melee side, as shown in the second example.

**Examples:**

##### General advice

Thumb kills are by far the trickiest to learn, as there are two variants and the on-tick variant is somewhat unintuitive. If you are struggling with this, one option is to simply mage 1t behind every time.

If you don't have a scythe, losing a tick to get 1t behind olm doesn't cost you, since you would have to lose a tick transitioning from (on-tick) mage hand to 4:1 anyways. If you do have a scythe, one easy and efficient way to get 1 tick behind without getting off lightning cycle is to replace a mage attack on the thumb with a scythe, as shown below.

## P3/Final Phase

Unfortunately, none of the methods listed above work for the final phase. This is because the addition of the healing special means that olm's attack cycle is no longer divisible by 3.

However, by doing conventional methods such as 4:1 (immediately at the beginning of the phase), 4:0, or mage 7:3, you can completely avoid teleports while killing the melee hand, and the odds of getting teleports while doing the mage hand are low enough and represent a small enough timeloss that I would not worry about it.

If you want to 100% avoid teleports, you need to count from the beginning of the phase, which I honestly would not recommend.

## Summary
To avoid teles during mage hand, line up your attack cycle with olm's such that the special you tank in between the safespots when you splash is lightning. The easiest way to do that is just to make sure that you mage from the melee safespot when olm does his sixth attack of the phase. You can also copy the many phase starts shown [here.](https://github.com/onetwosri/no-teleport-olm/blob/main/lightning%20cycle%20olm.md#phase-start-examples)

To avoid teles while setting up 4:1, you must do your check hits slightly differently based on where you do your last attack on the mage hand. The three possible positions are shown below:

1. melee safespot
2. mage side safespot
3. thumb

![](https://i.imgur.com/SpPwqmI.png)

There are 4 scenarios:
1. If you kill the mage hand from the mage side safespot, immediately hit the melee hand and tank your check hits without turning the head any more
2. If you kill the mage hand from the thumb while attacking on the same tick as olm, turn the head to melee safespot, tank a hit on the thumb, then turn the head again before tanking 2 hits to check cycle.
3. If you kill the mage hand from the thumb while attacking 1t after olm, turn the head to the melee safespot then tank your 2 hits to check cycle
4. If you kill the mage hand from the melee safespot, turn the head 3 times, then tank 2 hits to check cycle

Examples of all 4 scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/onetwosri/no-teleport-olm/blob/main/lightning%20cycle%20olm.md#setting-up-41).

If you do this correctly, you will never get teleports during any part of olm other than the final phase, where these methods don't work, but you can almost always avoid teleports p3 simply by doing conventional methods like 4:1, 4:0, or m7:3.
