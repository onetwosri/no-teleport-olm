# Guide to no teleport olm
#### by Sri and Fecal

## I. Mage Hand

For all phases other than the final phase, olm's attack cycle is as follows:

1. auto
2. null
3. auto
4. crystals
5. auto
6. null
7. auto
8. lightning
9. auto
10. null
11. auto
12. teleports

Meanwhile, running the mage hand can be considered a 3 attack cycle where you attack once from each of 3 locations:
1. melee hand safespot
2. mage side of head
3. the area in between the two safespots (will be called thumb for convenience)

Since olm's attack cycle is 12 attacks long and your mage hand cycle is 3 attacks long, you will go through exactly 4 iterations of your mage hand cycle. Here's a side by side comparison of olm's attack cycle vs. yours. Each colored number on the right represents one full mage hand cycle.

After teleports, both cycles repeat starting from the beginning. Since the cycle always stays the same, you are always at the same spot each time a particular special happens: you're in the melee safespot for crystals, the mage side safespot for lightning, and on the thumb for teleports. That means that every 4th attack that occurs when you are at the thumb is teleports.

Remember that the only time you tank a hit during mage hand is at when you are at the thumb and you splashed from the melee safespot two attacks prior (the exact mechanics of when olm faces middle on a splash vs turns towards mage hand are a bit more complicated but it's not really important so I haven't included it). This means that if you splash from the melee safespot, there is a 25% chance that you will get teleports on the thumb.

Obviously, this is not ideal. It would be much better if the special that occurred at the thumb was lightning or crystals instead of teleports. To make that happen, you have to shift your mage hand attack cycle relative to olm's, as shown below.

This image shows the three possible ways in which your mage hand cycle can line up with olm's attack cycle. Each one is named based on the special that occurs when you are at the thumb. As you can see, being on either crystal or lightning cycle allows you to avoid getting teleports during mage hand.

Of the two "good" cycles, you want to always be on **LIGHTNING** cycle. This may seem counterintuitive, since crystals are much less annoying than lightning, but this is the **_single most important factor_** for avoiding teles during the melee hand.

### Getting on lightning cycle

When you first start a phase, you are on teleport cycle by default. To get onto lightning cycle, you have to shift olm's attack cycle relative to your own so that he does lightning instead of teles on the thumb. The best time to do this is at the beginning of the phase when you spec the hand, since you want to get off teleport cycle ASAP.

The absolute simplest way to do this is to make sure that you are maging from the melee safespot when olm does his sixth attack. A tick by tick breakdown of standard phase starts is shown below:

Note that for p1, your first mage attack will be on the same tick as olm's first attack, and that for p2, you will do one mage attack 3 ticks before olm's first attack (not shown in diagram).

Where you stand before olm's 6th attack does not matter, although you obviously want to avoid as many of olm's attacks as possible.


### Phase start examples

I have included examples of phase starts for many common specing scenarios. 

**You do not need to memorize all of these.**

There are tons of ways to get onto lightning cycle, these clips just represent one way to do it. Feel free to figure out your own methods and do whatever is most comfortable for you. When in doubt, you can always use the 6th attack trick mentioned earlier; at most it will result in you tanking 1 more attack than necessary. Several of the examples below also follow the 6th attack rule.


#### 1 DWH Spec starts

1. Mage (hit) -> DWH (hit) -> Mage

    Note: If you splash the mage hit after hammer, do not run all the way to the melee safespot to avoid tanking a hit, doing so puts you on crystal cycle and you'll have to tank a hit at some point later to get back on lightning.

2. Mage (hit) -> DWH (miss) -> Mage

    Note: The 4:0 cycle after missing hammer is necessary to shift the cycle from teleports to lightning cycle. In this example I could have avoided tanking a hit by 4:0ing when I splashed instead of waiting and doing it later.

3. Mage (splash) -> DWH -> Mage (4:0 fix if no cripple, run mage side if cripple)

4. Mage (hit) -> DWH (hit) -> Scythe -> Mage

5. Mage (hit) -> DWH (miss) -> Scythe -> Mage


6. Mage (splash) -> DWH -> Scythe -> Mage


#### 2 DWH Spec starts



1. Mage (hit) -> DWH (miss) -> DWH (miss or hit under 30) -> lance -> mage

2. Mage (hit) -> DWH (miss) -> DWH (hit 30+ aka cripple) -> mage

    Use this one if you don't have a lance with you even if you don't cripple the hand.
