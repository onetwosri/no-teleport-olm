# Guide to no teleport olm
#### by Sri and Fecal

## I. Mage Hand

For all phases other than the final phase, olm's attack cycle is as follows:

1. auto
2. null
3. auto
4. crystals
5. auto
6. null
7. auto
8. lightning
9. auto
10. null
11. auto
12. teleports

Meanwhile, running the mage hand can be considered a 3 attack cycle where you attack once from each of 3 locations:
1. melee hand safespot
2. mage side of head
3. the area in between the two safespots (will be called thumb for convenience)

This means that for every iteration of olm's attack cycle, you will go through exactly 4 iterations of your mage hand cycle. Here's a side by side comparison of olm's attack cycle vs. yours. Each colored number on the right represents one full mage hand cycle.

After teleports, the cycle repeats, starting from the beginning. Since the cycle always stays the same, you are always at the same spot each time a particular special happens: you're in the melee safespot for crystals, the mage side safespot for lightning, and on the thumb for teleports. That means that every 4th attack that occurs when you are at the thumb is teleports.

Remember that the only time you tank a hit during mage hand is at when you are at the thumb and you splashed from the melee safespot two attacks prior (the exact mechanics of when olm faces middle on a splash vs turns towards mage hand are a bit more complicated but it's not really important so I haven't included it). This means that if you splash from the melee safespot, there is a 25% chance that you have to tank an attack from olm on the thumb and for that attack to be teleports.

Obviously, this is not ideal. It would be much better if the special that occurred at the thumb was lightning or crystals instead of teleports. To make that happen, you have to shift your mage hand attack cycle relative to olm's, as shown below.

This image shows the three possible ways in which your mage hand cycle can line up with olm's attack cycle. Each one is named based on the special that occurs when you are at the thumb. As you can see, being on either crystal or lightning cycle allows you to avoid getting teleported during mage hand.

Of the two "good" cycles, you want to always be on **LIGHTNING** cycle. This may seem counterintuitive, since crystals are much less annoying than lightning, but this is the **_single most important factor_** for avoiding teles during the melee hand.

## Getting on lightning cycle

When you first start a phase, you are on teleport cycle by default. To get onto lightning cycle, you have to shift olm's attack cycle relative to your own so that he does lightning instead of teles on the thumb. The easiest way to do this is at the beginning of the phase when you spec the hand.
