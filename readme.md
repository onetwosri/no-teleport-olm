# Guide to no teleport olm
#### by Sri and Fecal

## I. Mage Hand

For all phases other than the final phase, olm's attack cycle is as follows:

1. auto
2. null
3. auto
4. crystals
5. auto
6. null
7. auto
8. lightning
9. auto
10. null
11. auto
12. teleports

Meanwhile, running the mage hand can be considered a 3 attack cycle where you attack once from each of 3 locations:
1. melee hand safespot
2. mage side of head
3. the area in between the two safespots (will be called thumb for convenience)

This means that for every iteration of olm's attack cycle, you will go through exactly 4 iterations of your mage hand cycle.

After teleports, the cycle repeats, starting from the beginning. Since the cycle always stays the same, you are always at the same spot each time a particular special happens: you're in the melee safespot for crystals, the mage side safespot for lightning, and on the thumb for teleports. That means that every 4th attack from the thumb is teleports, and if you splash from the melee safespot and potentially have to tank a hit, there's a 25% chance that you will get teleported.

Remember that the only time you tank a hit during mage hand is at when you are at the thumb and you splashed from the melee safespot two attacks prior (the exact mechanics of when olm faces middle on a splash vs turns towards mage hand are a bit more complicated but it's not really important so I haven't included it). This means that if you splash from the melee safespot, there is a 25% chance that you have to tank an attack from olm on the thumb and for that attack to be teleports.

Obviously, this is not ideal. It would be much better if the special that occurred at the thumb was lightning or crystals instead of teleports. To make that happen, you have to shift your mage hand attack cycle relative to olm's, as shown below.
