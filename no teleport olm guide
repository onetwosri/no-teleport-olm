# No teleport olm
#### by Sri and Fecal

## I. Mage hand

For all phases other than the final phase, olm's attack cycle is as follows:

1. auto
2. null
3. auto
4. crystals
5. auto
6. null
7. auto
8. lightning
9. auto
10. null
11. auto
12. teleports

Meanwhile, running the mage hand can be considered a 3 attack cycle where you attack once from each of 3 locations:
1. melee hand safespot
2. mage side of head
3. the area in between the two safespots (will be called thumb for convenience)



Since olm's attack cycle is 12 attacks long, you go through 4 complete iterations of the mage hand cycle per iteration of olm's attack cycle. This means that each of olm's specials will always occur at the same point in your mage hand cycle.
